# Ray-Tracing
A simulation of a scene with 3 reflective spheres, and a light source being a point object.

This project illustrates the effect of ray tracing on a pre described scene. The scene consists of spheres, with varying degrees of reflectons. I have used the Blinn Phong model for calculating the colour of a pixel. The Scaled Up Version of the project creates a Video output by collecting 50 images with different camera angles and screen positions. Rotation matrix has been used for implementing this, and the collected frames were merged together sequentially to form a video.
